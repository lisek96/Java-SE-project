# Java-SE-project
Housing estate simulator :)

This is my first bigger java project, you control the application using console. On the start of the program you choose a person you want to be and then you can perform operations like renting an apartment, putting items in your apartment, putting your car in the garage, etc. There is another thread going concurrently which simulates the time flow. If you rented a house and you didn't prolong this rent, you get ejected from your apartment. If you get ejected 3 times, you cannot rent an apartment anymore. You can do a lot more than that, you have like 20 options to discover! :) To check all functionalities that I have programmed for this project, go to main method and check method names in switch{case}block.

Project finished 05.2020

**It's nice to look back at projects like this because I know I have improved a lot from then but still even now I feel proud of myself :)
