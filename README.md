# Java-SE-project
Housing estate simulator :)

This is my first bigger java project, you control the application by console. On the start you choose a person you want to be and then you can perform operations like 
renting an apartment, put items there, put your car in the garage, etc. There is another thread going concurrently which simulates the time flow. If you rented a house and 
you dont prolong this rent, you get ejected from your apartment. If you get ejected 3 times, you cannot rent an apartment anymore. You can do a lot more than that, you have like
20 options to discover.

Project is not MVC so it's hard to check this project but sorry back then I haven't known how to write MVC even though I knew what was it.. To check functionalities just go to main
methods, there's a biiig switch/case where all options are listed.



**It's nice to look back at projects like this because I know I have improved a lot from then but still even now I feel proud of myself :)
